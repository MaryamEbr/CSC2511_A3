Since I already had an AWS account I tried Amazon's real time ASR transcription.
In which you can start streating and talk and then it will transcribe in real-time for you.
It was easy to work with and smart.

for one word version I had:
"pipeline"

It was correctly transcribed => "pipeline"

for one sentence version I had:
"There are several steps to building this pipeline."

with the 5 second, normal speed, it was transcribed as:
"There are several steps to building this pipeline." (exactly the same)

with 10 seconds, slow speed, it was transcribed as:
"There are
several steps to building this pipe line"

with extra new line (because of my pause) and the word pipeline turning to pipe line (because I talked slowly)

All in all, it seems like a smart tool, for normal talking speed.
during my talk it sometimes went back to previous words to correct the mistakes.
and it finally could reach the correct sentence for most of the things that I tried.
