# Speech-Recognition-with-Gaussian-Mixture-Models
This repository contains the code for a computer assignment for Natural Language Computing course (CSC401/2511, Winter 2022, UofT)

The assignment is about Gaussian mixture modeling, recurrent neural networks with acoustic
data, and three basic tasks in speech technology: speaker identification, in which we try to determine who
is talking, speech recognition, in which we try to determine what was said, and basic sequence modeling.
The assignment is divided into two sections. In the first, we experiment with acoustic-based
classification for 1) speaker identification, and 2) deception detection. In the second section, we
evaluate two speech recognition engines. The codes are in Python.

The data come from the CSC Deceptive Speech corpus, which was developed by Columbia University, SRI International, and University of Colorado Boulder. It consists of 32 hours of audio interviews
from 32 native speakers of Standard American English (16 male, 16 female) recruited from the Columbia
University student population and the community. The purpose of the study was to distinguish deceptive
speech from non-deceptive speech using machine learning techniques on extracted features from the corpus.
